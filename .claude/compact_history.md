Built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for storing and retrieving error information from Claude Code sessions using FastAPI and ChromaDB (vector database).

Created:
- Data models for error records (type, context, solution)
- Storage interface with ChromaDB implementation
- REST API with endpoints for CRUD operations and similarity search
- Authentication using API keys
- Text processing utilities
- Placeholder AWS integrations for future cloud deployment
- Example client script
- Tests and documentation

The server allows storing error contexts with solutions and finding similar errors via vector search. Architecture supports local usage with easy path to cloud deployment.

Core tech: Python, FastAPI, ChromaDB, JWT authentication

## Project Overview
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for storing and retrieving error information
- Uses ChromaDB for vector search to find relevant past errors
- FastAPI framework for REST API endpoints
- Optional authentication for local development
- Configurable port selection

## Implementation Details
- Main package in src/learned_knowledge_mcp/
- Example API client in src/examples/api_client.py
- Poetry for dependency management
- Docker and CI/CD configurations

## Core Functionality
- Store error contexts, solutions, and metadata
- Search by exact match or semantic similarity
- Authentication via API keys (optional for local dev)
- RESTful API with JSON for data exchange

## Next Steps
1. Implement AWS storage classes for cloud deployment
2. Add more comprehensive tests
3. Create example error data
4. Extend vector search capabilities

# Conversation Summary - 2025-03-06 14:32

We have been working on implementing end-to-end tests for the Learned Knowledge MCP server, which is a Model Context Protocol server that stores and retrieves error information using ChromaDB for vector search.

### What we did:
1. Created a comprehensive end-to-end test file with several test cases:
   - Testing basic error record creation and retrieval
   - Testing exact match searches by error type, language, and framework
   - Testing semantic similarity searches for similar error messages
   - Testing a real-world workflow of storing errors and retrieving solutions for similar problems

2. Encountered an issue with NumPy 2.0 compatibility with ChromaDB (specifically the deprecated np.float_ type)

3. Fixed the dependency by pinning NumPy to a version below 2.0 in the pyproject.toml file

4. Attempted to run the tests but encountered some environment/shell issues

### Current state:
- The tests are properly written but not yet executed due to environment configuration issues
- We have updated the Poetry dependencies to resolve the NumPy version issue

### Files we are working on:
- tests/test_end_to_end.py: Contains the end-to-end tests
- pyproject.toml: Contains the Poetry configuration with the NumPy version constraint

### Next steps:
We need to properly run the tests to verify they work.

# Conversation Summary (2025-03-06)

We've been setting up integration between Claude Code and the Learned Knowledge MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to automatically track and store programming errors and their solutions.

## What we did:
- Examined the MCP server codebase, focusing on the API structure (`api/errors.py`) and data models (`models/error_record.py`)
- Reviewed an example API client (`examples/api_client.py`) to understand the interface
- Created detailed integration instructions in `instructions.md` with two Python scripts:
  1. `claude_mcp_integration.py`: Core API client for communicating with the MCP server
  2. `claude_mcp_plugin.py`: Claude-specific integration for error tracking and solution storage
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to include integration instructions for future Claude sessions

## Current state:
- The MCP server is running and functional
- We have a complete integration design that allows Claude to:
  - Track errors and check for known solutions
  - Store successful solutions back to the MCP database
  - Build a knowledge base specific to your coding patterns over time

## Files we're working on:
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/instructions.md`
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/CLAUDE.md`

## Next steps:
1. Create the actual integration Python scripts based on the instructions
2. Update the paths in `CLAUDE.md` to point to the real script locations
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., `MCP_API_KEY` if authentication is enabled)
4. Test the integration by intentionally creating errors and verifying they're stored
5. Consider further enhancements like auto-reporting errors or expanding the solution database# Conversation Summary - Thu Mar  6 17:32:21 PST 2025

We integrated the Learned Knowledge MCP (Model Context Protocol) application with Claude for Desktop and the Claude Code CLI. The system provides an error tracking and retrieval mechanism through MCP.

## What we did:

1. **Fixed Docker configuration**:
   - Changed the Docker container name to `mcp_learned_knowledge`
   - Modified the port mapping to `8081:5000` to avoid conflicts
   - Updated Docker service configuration for proper naming

2. **Handled FastMCP compatibility issues**:
   - Added debug mode in `server.py` to keep the container running even when encountering errors
   - Used a specific FastMCP version (0.4.1) that works in the Docker environment
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms to maintain connectivity

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Enhanced the main project README.md with detailed integration instructions
   - Added instructions for both Claude for Desktop and Claude Code CLI
   - Included Docker container verification steps
   - Removed the redundant mcp_server folder

## Key files we worked on:

- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific notes
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/mcp_server/server.py` (now removed)
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/mcp_server/docker-compose.yml` (now removed)

## Current state:

- Docker container `mcp_learned_knowledge` is running on port 8081
- Container stays running in debug mode to maintain connectivity
- Main README.md has been updated with complete integration instructions

## What's next:

1. Test the integration with Claude for Desktop using the running Docker container
2. Test the integration with Claude Code CLI 
3. Consider further enhancements to the error database functionality
4. Potentially modify the Docker debug mode to improve functionality while maintaining reliability
