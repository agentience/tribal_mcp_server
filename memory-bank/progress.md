# Project Progress: Tribal

## Current Status Overview
As of March 22, 2025, the Tribal project is in active development with version 0.1.0. The core functionality is implemented and stable, while additional features and improvements are being added systematically. The current focus is on implementing a comprehensive versioning strategy to support sustainable long-term development.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Error record creation and storage via API
- ✅ Error record retrieval by UUID
- ✅ Vector-based similarity search
- ✅ JWT authentication and authorization
- ✅ ChromaDB integration for vector storage
- ✅ Complete error context capture (language, code, solution, etc.)

### MCP Integration
- ✅ MCP server implementation
- ✅ MCP tools for error tracking and retrieval
- ✅ Direct integration with Claude and other MCP clients
- ✅ Error semantic similarity search via MCP

### Infrastructure
- ✅ FastAPI REST endpoints
- ✅ API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- ✅ CLI interface with core commands
- ✅ Docker deployment
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD
- ✅ Version management and automated bumping

### Documentation
- ✅ Installation and setup guides
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ MCP integration documentation
- ✅ Versioning strategy documentation

## What's Left to Build

### In Progress
- 🔄 Branch creation and PR preparation helpers (design phase)
- 🔄 Comprehensive test suite for migrations (planning)
- 🔄 Branch protection rules implementation (planning)

### Planned (Short-term)
- 📋 Critical test suite for hotfix workflows
- 📋 CHANGELOG automation from PR descriptions
- 📋 Additional version consistency validations

### Planned (Medium-term)
- 📋 Performance optimizations for large datasets
- 📋 Enhanced AWS integration for cloud deployment
- 📋 Expanded CLI commands for workflow management
- 📋 Improved admin interfaces

### Planned (Long-term)
- 📋 Custom embedding model integration
- 📋 Real-time collaboration features
- 📋 Distributed deployment support
- 📋 Analytics and usage reporting

## Known Issues

### Technical Limitations
- 🐞 Single-node deployment only (no clustering)
- 🐞 Limited customization of vector embedding strategies
- 🐞 Basic authentication without OAuth flows

### Performance Concerns
- 🐞 Large dataset performance not yet optimized
- 🐞 Search performance degradation with very large collections

### Schema Limitations
- 🐞 Limited support for complex nested error contexts
- 🐞 Complex schema migration testing not fully automated
