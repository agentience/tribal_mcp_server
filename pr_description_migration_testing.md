# Migration Testing Framework Implementation

## Jira Issue
- **Key**: TMS-119
- **Summary**: Create Migration Testing Framework

## Changes
This PR implements a comprehensive testing framework for schema migrations in the Tribal project, enabling thorough testing of the migration paths between different schema versions.

### Key Components Added
1. **Migration Test Helpers** (`tests/unit/helpers/migration_test_helpers.py`)
   - Mock implementations of ChromaDB components for testing
   - Utilities for creating and tracking test migrations
   - Helper functions for complex migration scenarios
   - Assertion utilities for migration path validation

2. **Unit Tests for Migration Framework** (`tests/unit/test_migration_framework.py`)
   - Tests for linear migration paths
   - Tests for complex migration scenarios with multiple paths
   - Tests for compatibility checking between app and schema versions
   - Tests for ChromaDB-specific migrations

3. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_migration_integration.py`)
   - Tests for real-world migration scenarios
   - Tests for schema evolution (adding fields, changing structure)
   - Tests for multi-step migrations
   - Tests for fresh installation migrations

## Testing
All tests pass successfully, validating the migration framework's functionality:
- Linear migration paths work correctly
- Complex migration paths with multiple branches are handled correctly
- Schema version compatibility is checked properly
- Multi-step migrations execute in the correct order
- Migrations with errors are handled gracefully

## Technical Details
The testing framework provides:
1. **Realistic Mocks**: Simulates ChromaDB collections and documents
2. **Migration Tracking**: Monitors which migrations are executed and in what order
3. **Schema Validation**: Tests compatibility between app and schema versions
4. **Scenario Testing**: Tests both simple and complex migration scenarios

## Future Improvements
- Add more complex migration scenarios
- Add performance tests for large datasets
- Integrate with CI pipeline for automated testing of schema migrations

## Related Documentation
- Update `VERSIONING.md` with information about migration testing
- Document migration testing framework in developer documentation
