## Jira Issue Management

Use jira-server to manage Jira issues for the project.

When working with Jira issues, follow these guidelines:

- **Issue Status**: Always set a Jira issue to "In Progress" before beginning work on it
- **Subtasks**: Create subtasks when appropriate to break down larger issues into manageable pieces
- **Issue References**: Include Jira issue IDs in commit messages and PR descriptions (e.g., "AT-123: Fix authentication bug")
- **Issue Updates**: Regularly update issue status and add comments with progress updates
- **Definition of Done**: Only mark issues as "Done" when all acceptance criteria are met, including tests and documentation

# Tribal Branching Strategy

## Current Development Workflow
As we are currently the sole developer on the project, we're using a simplified workflow:
- Create feature branches from develop as needed
- Once a feature branch is complete and tested, merge it directly back to develop (no PR required)
- Run all tests before merging to ensure code quality

This approach will be revised when more developers join the project.

## Branch Types and Uses
- main: Production code only
- develop: Integration branch for features
- feature/*: New features from develop
- bugfix/*: Non-critical fixes from develop
- hotfix/*: Critical fixes from main
- release/*: Release preparation from develop
- docs/*: Documentation changes from develop. Do not create a new branch for changes to files under the memory-bank directory.

## Version Bumping Rules
- feature branches: No version changes
- bugfix branches: No version changes
- release branches: Minor or major version bump
- hotfix branches: Patch version bump
- docs branches: No version changes

## Branch Naming Convention
- feature/TMS-123-brief-description
- bugfix/TMS-123-brief-description
- hotfix/1.0.1-brief-description
- release/1.1.0
- docs/update-readme

## When Helping with Code Changes
1. Always check what branch we're on first
2. Suggest the appropriate branch type for the changes
3. Ensure version bumping follows the rules above
4. Remind about running tests before merging to develop
5. Help craft clear commit messages with issue IDs
