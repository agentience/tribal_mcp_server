# Conversation Summary - Thu Mar  6 17:32:21 PST 2025

We integrated the Learned Knowledge MCP (Model Context Protocol) application with Claude for Desktop and the Claude Code CLI. The system provides an error tracking and retrieval mechanism through MCP.

## What we did:

1. **Fixed Docker configuration**:
   - Changed the Docker container name to `mcp_learned_knowledge`
   - Modified the port mapping to `8081:5000` to avoid conflicts
   - Updated Docker service configuration for proper naming

2. **Handled FastMCP compatibility issues**:
   - Added debug mode in `server.py` to keep the container running even when encountering errors
   - Used a specific FastMCP version (0.4.1) that works in the Docker environment
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms to maintain connectivity

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Enhanced the main project README.md with detailed integration instructions
   - Added instructions for both Claude for Desktop and Claude Code CLI
   - Included Docker container verification steps
   - Removed the redundant mcp_server folder

## Key files we worked on:

- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific notes
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/mcp_server/server.py` (now removed)
- `/Users/troymolander/Development/Agentience/learned_knowledge_mcp/mcp_server/docker-compose.yml` (now removed)

## Current state:

- Docker container `mcp_learned_knowledge` is running on port 8081
- Container stays running in debug mode to maintain connectivity
- Main README.md has been updated with complete integration instructions

## What's next:

1. Test the integration with Claude for Desktop using the running Docker container
2. Test the integration with Claude Code CLI 
3. Consider further enhancements to the error database functionality
4. Potentially modify the Docker debug mode to improve functionality while maintaining reliability
