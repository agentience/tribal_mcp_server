# Conversation Summary: Tribal CLI Project Restructuring

## What We Did

1. **Transitioned from Poetry to uv**:
   - Replaced Poetry dependency management with uv
   - Created a modern pyproject.toml structure for uv
   - Removed unnecessary files like requirements.txt and setup.py

2. **Renamed the Project**:
   - Changed project name from "learned_knowledge_mcp" to "tribal"
   - Renamed the main package from "learned_knowledge_mcp" to "mcp_server_tribal"
   - Updated all internal references and imports throughout the codebase

3. **Improved CLI Structure**:
   - Enhanced mcp_app.py to support subcommands (server, version, help)
   - Made "tribal" the main command entry point
   - Created proper command handling in the CLI interface

4. **Changed Build System**:
   - Switched from setuptools to hatchling as the build backend
   - Updated build configuration for the new structure
   - Set up proper package inclusion with src layout

5. **Tested the Setup**:
   - Created a virtual environment with uv
   - Installed the project in development mode using `uv add --dev --editable .`
   - Tested the tribal command with `tribal version` and `tribal help`

## Key Files Modified

1. **Configuration Files**:
   - `/pyproject.toml` - Updated project metadata, dependencies, and build config
   - `/.python-version` - Created to specify Python version for uv

2. **Package Files**:
   - `/src/mcp_server_tribal/__init__.py` - Updated package description and version
   - `/src/mcp_server_tribal/mcp_app.py` - Enhanced with proper CLI structure
   - `/src/mcp_server_tribal/app.py` - Updated imports and server description
   - `/src/mcp_server_tribal/_scripts/__init__.py` - Updated references
   - `/src/mcp_server_tribal/cli/*` - Updated command references

## Current State

- Project is now named "tribal" with main package "mcp_server_tribal"
- All CLI commands work properly through the "tribal" entry point
- The project uses uv for dependency management and virtual environments
- The code structure follows modern Python package layout with src directory

## Next Steps

1. Consider renaming the project directory from "learned_knowledge_mcp" to "tribal"
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines to build and publish the package
3. Add more comprehensive testing for the CLI interface
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure and commands
5. Create a proper release process using uv's build capabilities

The project is now well-structured according to modern Python packaging standards, and dependency management is handled by uv instead of Poetry.
