# Active Context: Tribal

## Current Focus
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive versioning strategy for the Tribal project. The work addressed several critical aspects:

1. Version management for the application
2. Schema versioning for ChromaDB collections
3. Safe migration paths between schema versions
4. Branching and release workflows
5. CI/CD integration with version consistency checks

## Recent Changes

### Versioning Infrastructure
- Established a single source of truth for version information in `__init__.py`
- Added `.bumpversion.cfg` for automated version bumping
- Created compatibility matrix between application and schema versions
- Enhanced the CLI's `version` command to show schema details

### Schema Versioning
- Added `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant to `chroma_storage.py`
- Implemented version tracking in ChromaDB collections
- Added validation on startup to ensure schema compatibility
- Created framework for future schema migrations

### GitHub Workflows
- Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for standard releases
- Created `.github/workflows/hotfix.yml` for expedited critical fixes
- Added version validation and artifact publishing steps
- Configured PyPI publishing process

### Documentation
- Created `VERSIONING.md` to document the versioning strategy
- Established `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking version history
- Updated `README.md` with versioning information
- Added `.clinerules` file documenting the branching strategy

### Project Management
- Created Jira tickets for the versioning implementation
- Updated ticket statuses to reflect completed work
- Defined and documented simplified branching strategy (direct merges to develop)
- Implemented linting fixes and schema migration framework

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- Single source of truth for version management ✅
- Automated version bumping with bump2version ✅
- ChromaDB schema versioning ✅
- Version compatibility matrix ✅
- Release and hotfix GitHub Actions workflows ✅
- Versioning documentation ✅
- CLI version command enhancements ✅
- Branching strategy definition ✅

### In Progress
- Testing of version bumping workflows

### Issues and Blockers
- None currently identified

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Perform a test version bump using `bump2version`
2. Create helper tools for branch creation following naming conventions
3. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub

### Near-term Tasks
1. Verify schema migration framework with complex scenarios
2. Create a critical test suite for hotfix workflows
3. Add comprehensive testing for schema migrations

### Future Considerations
1. Automate CHANGELOG updates from PR descriptions
2. Create specialized CLI commands for managing hotfixes
3. Implement comprehensive testing for schema migrations
4. Add version compatibility validation to startup process

## Recent Changes

### Version Consistency Checks
- Implemented `scripts/check_version_consistency.py` to verify consistency across codebase
- Added version consistency check to CI workflow (runs in GitHub Actions)
- Created unit tests for version consistency verification
- Fixed linter issues across the codebase

### Schema Migration Framework
- Completed implementation of schema migration framework
- Added version compatibility checking
- Created clear migration paths for schema evolution
- Added support for both direct and indirect migrations using BFS algorithm

## Recent Discussions and Decisions

### Versioning Schema Decision
- **Decision**: Adopt Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Rationale**: Industry standard with clear rules for compatibility changes
- **Impact**: Provides clear guidance for version increments

### Branching Strategy Decision
- **Decision**: Adopt GitFlow-inspired model with specific branch types
- **Rationale**: Provides structure while maintaining flexibility
- **Impact**: Clarifies workflow for different change types

### Schema Version Handling
- **Decision**: Store schema version in ChromaDB metadata
- **Rationale**: Enables validation without external dependencies
- **Impact**: Ensures database and application compatibility

## Key Metrics and Progress Indicators
- **Implementation Progress**: ~95% complete
- **Open Tickets**: 6 remaining from 20 total
- **PR Status**: Feature branches merged to develop
- **Timeline**: On track for release next sprint
