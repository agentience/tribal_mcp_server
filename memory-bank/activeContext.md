# Active Context: Tribal

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on implementing a comprehensive versioning strategy for the Tribal project. This work addresses several critical aspects:

1. Version management for the application
2. Schema versioning for ChromaDB collections
3. Safe migration paths between schema versions
4. Branching and release workflows
5. CI/CD integration

## Recent Changes

### Versioning Infrastructure
- Established a single source of truth for version information in `__init__.py`
- Added `.bumpversion.cfg` for automated version bumping
- Created compatibility matrix between application and schema versions
- Enhanced the CLI's `version` command to show schema details

### Schema Versioning
- Added `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant to `chroma_storage.py`
- Implemented version tracking in ChromaDB collections
- Added validation on startup to ensure schema compatibility
- Created framework for future schema migrations

### GitHub Workflows
- Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for standard releases
- Created `.github/workflows/hotfix.yml` for expedited critical fixes
- Added version validation and artifact publishing steps
- Configured PyPI publishing process

### Documentation
- Created `VERSIONING.md` to document the versioning strategy
- Established `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking version history
- Updated `README.md` with versioning information
- Added `.clinerules` file documenting the branching strategy

### Project Management
- Created Jira tickets for the versioning implementation
- Updated ticket statuses to reflect completed work
- Defined branching strategy and documentation
- Pushed changes to feature branch for review

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- Single source of truth for version management ✅
- Automated version bumping with bump2version ✅
- ChromaDB schema versioning ✅
- Version compatibility matrix ✅
- Release and hotfix GitHub Actions workflows ✅
- Versioning documentation ✅
- CLI version command enhancements ✅
- Branching strategy definition ✅

### In Progress
- Schema migration framework (partially implemented)
- PR review pending
- Testing of version bumping workflows

### Issues and Blockers
- None currently identified

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete PR review and merge to `develop` branch
2. Perform a test version bump using `bump2version`
3. Finalize implementation of schema migration framework
4. Add version consistency checks to CI workflow

### Near-term Tasks
1. Create helper tools for branch creation following naming conventions
2. Implement PR preparation helpers for workflow adherence
3. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub
4. Create a critical test suite for hotfix workflows

### Future Considerations
1. Automate CHANGELOG updates from PR descriptions
2. Create specialized CLI commands for managing hotfixes
3. Implement comprehensive testing for schema migrations
4. Add version compatibility validation to startup process

## Recent Discussions and Decisions

### Versioning Schema Decision
- **Decision**: Adopt Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Rationale**: Industry standard with clear rules for compatibility changes
- **Impact**: Provides clear guidance for version increments

### Branching Strategy Decision
- **Decision**: Adopt GitFlow-inspired model with specific branch types
- **Rationale**: Provides structure while maintaining flexibility
- **Impact**: Clarifies workflow for different change types

### Schema Version Handling
- **Decision**: Store schema version in ChromaDB metadata
- **Rationale**: Enables validation without external dependencies
- **Impact**: Ensures database and application compatibility

## Key Metrics and Progress Indicators
- **Implementation Progress**: ~80% complete
- **Open Tickets**: 8 remaining from 20 total
- **PR Status**: Feature branch pushed, awaiting review
- **Timeline**: On track for integration in next sprint
